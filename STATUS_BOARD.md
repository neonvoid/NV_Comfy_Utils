## Resume Context
<!-- Rewritten each `/handoff` run. What does a cold-start agent need RIGHT NOW? -->

- **Current focus:** Runtime test Kling sequential chunk mode on >10s video. Also: clean test of tail-as-control-video for chunk seam continuity.
- **Critical files:** `src/KNF_Utils/kling_edit_fork.py`, `src/KNF_Utils/vace_control_video_prep.py`, `src/KNF_Utils/vace_prepass_reference.py`
- **Known blockers:** Stitch crash fixes not yet applied (VRAM cleanup, frame validation, NaN warp guard).
- **Environment notes:** KlingStitchAdapter deprecated in __init__.py. Known-truths deep-dive at `~/.multi-ai/research/20260406-155057/` needs synthesis.

## Pulse
<!-- Last 2 session summaries, newest first. Older entries roll to Workstream Details. -->

### 2026-04-07b — Kling sequential chunking + KlingStitchAdapter deprecated [coding]
- **Done:**
  - Added sequential chunk mode to NV_KlingUploadPreview: `chunk_mode`, `chunk_start_frame`, `prev_chunk_output`, `tail_ref_count` inputs + `next_chunk_start` output
  - Auto-truncates long videos to ~10s per chunk (snapped to 8k+1), extracts tail frames from previous chunk as ref images, auto-appends consistency prompt
  - Deprecated KlingStitchAdapter (unregistered from __init__.py) — Kling edit mode doesn't reliably preserve framing/camera
  - Multi-AI review (Codex): fixed max_chunk_frames formula (was overshooting by 1 frame at 24fps), collapsed duplicate fps resolution into single source of truth
- **Decisions:** KlingStitchAdapter deprecated — Kling edit doesn't preserve framing (D-018). No overlap/crossfade between chunks — same framing instability applies (D-019).
- **Blockers:** None — awaiting runtime test
- **Next:** Runtime test chunked Kling on a >10s video. Test tail-frame refs actually improve cross-chunk consistency. Consider if chunk_mode should auto-detect (video >10s = auto-enable).

### 2026-04-07 — Tail-as-control-video approach + mask wiring clarification [coding + testing]
- **Done:**
  - Tested latent tail (sampler output): zero color drift confirmed BUT introduced color/sharpness shift from sampler-vs-encoder domain mismatch (D-015). Both pixel and latent tail approaches add artifacts.
  - Pivoted to Approach B: tail as mask=0 control video frames in NV_VaceControlVideoPrep (D-016). Tail prepended at END of pipeline (after all mask analysis) to avoid contaminating inscribed radius/bbox/erosion.
  - Fixed critical review bugs: moved tail prepend from Step 0 to Step 11, output order preserved (tail_trim appended as 6th output), 4k+1 frame count enforcement (step=4, runtime snap), device/dtype alignment.
  - Confirmed stitch mask splotches are PRE-EXISTING (not from our tail changes) — SAM3 segmentation noise.
  - Clarified mask wiring: `control_masks` → VacePrePassReference ONLY; `cropped_mask_processed` → CropColorFix; `stitch_mask` → InpaintStitch2.
- **Decisions:** Sampler-output and VAE-encoder latents are NOT interchangeable (D-015). Tail-as-control-video preferred (D-016). `control_masks` NEVER goes to CropColorFix or InpaintStitch (D-017).
- **Blockers:** Stitch crash fixes still not applied. Tail-as-control-video needs clean end-to-end test.
- **Next:** Clean test of tail-as-control-video approach. Apply stitch crash fixes. Synthesize known-truths deep-dive. Run /handoff cleanup.

## System Constraints
<!-- Cross-cutting platform rules that affect all workstreams. -->

- ComfyUI caches Python modules — code changes require server restart to take effect
- `padding_mode='border'` in `grid_sample` causes edge-stretching artifacts — use `reflection` or `zeros`
- VACE neutral fill must be 0.5 (not 0.6/#999999) — WanVaceToVideo centers by -0.5
- `feather_blocks` must NEVER be 0 — hard mask edges cause Gibbs ringing in VAE
- Isotropic mask expansion (`vace_input_grow_px`) expands in ALL directions — problematic when content only extends in one direction
- ComfyUI `widgets_values` maps by POSITION not by NAME — renaming params scrambles old workflow values
- CropColorFix `composite_mode=multiband` pulls low-freq dark BG energy into character edges via Laplacian pyramid — use `hard` or `blend_pixels≤4` on dark backgrounds
- `crop_expand_px` only affects stitch when `crop_stitch_source=processed` or `hybrid` — has NO effect in `tight` mode
- Latent tail must come from sampler output (post-trim, pre-decode) — pixel re-encode introduces compounding color drift
- Identity anchor requires color normalization before mixing with CropColorFix'd VACE refs — raw Kling causes brightness shift
- `reference_latents` conditioning key is dead code for WAN — only Flux/Lumina/Omnigen read it. Use VACE `vace_frames` mask=0
- Multi-pass pipelines compound ~7/255 color drift per pass — CropColorFix corrects per-pass but cannot prevent drift entering VACE conditioning
- Latent-space cropping is BROKEN for WAN 3D VAE — spatial+temporal CausalConv3d receptive field makes latent crop ≠ pixel crop
- Sampler-output latents and VAE-encoder-output latents are NOT interchangeable — different distributions cause color/sharpness shift when mixed in VACE conditioning
- `control_masks` (from VaceControlVideoPrep) goes ONLY to VacePrePassReference/WanVaceToVideo — never to CropColorFix or InpaintStitch
- Kling edit mode does NOT preserve original framing/camera — output cannot be stitched back onto original frames. Use as standalone output, not as InpaintStitch input.

## Project Decisions Index
<!-- Numbered decisions with lifecycle status. Never renumber IDs. -->

| ID | Date | Status | Workstream | Description |
|----|------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| D-001 | 2026-04-01 | ACTIVE | A | Prefixed naming convention: `cleanup_*`, `crop_*`, `vace_*` (not double-underscore) |
| D-002 | 2026-04-01 | ACTIVE | A | One config node with categorized params (not split into multiple nodes, not modes/presets) |
| D-003 | 2026-04-01 | SUPERSEDED → D-006 | A | `resolve_deprecated()` uses value equality — replaced by full removal of deprecated params |
| D-004 | 2026-04-01 | ACTIVE | B | Crop clamped to frame bounds (no canvas extension). Isotropic shrink preserves aspect ratio. |
| D-005 | 2026-04-01 | ACTIVE | B | Stitch inverse warp uses `zeros` padding (not reflection) — compositing is mask-gated so zeros are invisible |
| D-006 | 2026-04-02 | ACTIVE | A | Remove all deprecated params — no backward compat for old workflows. Clean UI. |
| D-007 | 2026-04-02 | ACTIVE | A | `forceInput:True` does NOT preserve old widget values — ComfyUI treats as connection-only inputs |
| D-008 | 2026-04-03 | ACTIVE | C | `boundary_lock` restores original pixels via `torch.where`, doesn't darken — exposes what multiband created |
| D-009 | 2026-04-03 | ACTIVE | C | Use `crop_expand_px` for spatial coverage, NOT CropColorFix `blend_expansion` (causes dark borders) |
| D-010 | 2026-04-06 | ACTIVE | E | Skip identity_anchor until color-normalized — raw Kling brightness differs from CropColorFix'd VACE output |
| D-011 | 2026-04-06 | ACTIVE | E | Committed noise (Jan 2026) empirically failed for fine-detail drift; `reference_latents` dead code for WAN |
| D-012 | 2026-04-06 | SUPERSEDED → D-016 | E | Use sampler latent output as tail source — superseded by tail-as-control-video approach |
| D-013 | 2026-04-06 | ACTIVE | E | Latent tail: no frame_repeat (already natural temporal), no ref_strength scaling (preserve exact state) |
| D-014 | 2026-04-06 | ACTIVE | E | VACE late-block skip connections (10/40 DiT blocks) confirmed as mechanism for fine-detail conditioning |
| D-015 | 2026-04-07 | ACTIVE | E | Sampler-output latents ≠ VAE-encoder latents — different distributions cause artifacts when mixed |
| D-016 | 2026-04-07 | PROVISIONAL | E | Tail-as-control-video (mask=0 in control region) preferred — native VACE inpainting VCU pattern |
| D-017 | 2026-04-07 | ACTIVE | C,E | `control_masks` → VACE only. CropColorFix uses `cropped_mask_processed`. InpaintStitch uses `stitch_mask`. |
| D-018 | 2026-04-07 | ACTIVE | F | KlingStitchAdapter deprecated — Kling edit mode doesn't reliably preserve framing/camera for stitch-back |
| D-019 | 2026-04-07 | ACTIVE | F | No chunk overlap/crossfade — same framing instability that killed stitch makes crossfade produce ghosting |

## Workstream Details
<!-- Per-workstream context: state, goals, key files, decisions, milestones, history. -->
<!-- Read ONLY the workstream you're about to touch. -->

### A. Mask Pipeline UX Refactor
**Current state:** ACTIVE — implementation complete, awaiting runtime test
**Goal:** Rename mask params by stage/intent, promote mask_grow+halo to config, add debug preview node
**Key files:** `mask_processing_config.py`, `vace_control_video_prep.py`, `inpaint_crop.py`, `vace_debug_preview.py`, `mask_pipeline_viz.py`, `latent_inpaint_crop.py`, `temporal_mask_stabilizer.py`, `mask_tracking_bbox.py`
**Active constraints:** Deprecated params fully removed (D-006) — no backward compat. Old workflows must be re-wired.

**Milestones:**
- 2026-04-01 — All 9 files renamed + NV_VaceDebugPreview created, syntax verified

**History:**
- **2026-04-01 | refactor**
  Outcome: Renamed all mask params across 9 files with backward compat, promoted mask_grow+halo to config, created NV_VaceDebugPreview
  Decision: Prefixed naming (D-001), one config node (D-002), value-equality deprecation (D-003)
  Next: Runtime test with ComfyUI restart, test old workflows, update CHANGELOG
- **2026-04-01 | refactor (rolled from Pulse)**
  Outcome: Crop hard-clamp to frame bounds, CoTracker reflection padding, stitch zeros padding, input validation overhaul
  Decision: Crop clamped (D-004), stitch zeros (D-005)
  Next: Runtime test edge-of-frame artifacts

### B. Edge-of-Frame Fix
**Current state:** STABLE — shipped and runtime tested
**Goal:** Eliminate pixel-stretching artifacts when crop/warp extends beyond frame boundary
**Key files:** `inpaint_crop.py` (crop_for_inpaint), `cotracker_bridge.py`, `inpaint_stitch.py`
**Active constraints:** Cannot break CoTracker expand-crop-trim logic

**Milestones:**
- 2026-04-01 — Three-fix approach: crop clamp + reflection forward warp + zeros inverse warp

**History:**
- **2026-04-01 | coding**
  Outcome: Fixed crop (hard clamp + isotropic shrink), CoTracker (reflection), stitch (zeros). Multi-AI reviewed — approved with concerns.
  Decision: Crop clamp over canvas extension (D-004), zeros over reflection for inverse warp (D-005)
  Next: Runtime test — verify no stretching artifacts remain

### C. Clothing/Bag Swap Pipeline
**Current state:** ACTIVE — production use driving bug discovery
**Goal:** VACE inpainting for bag replacement and jacket swap on fashion video
**Key files:** Workflow files in `Z:\DerekWorkspace\0327_ClothingSwap\bags\`
**Active constraints:** Shot-dependent mask settings — no one-size-fits-all preset

**Milestones:**
- 2026-03-31 — Bag swap workflow identified grey artifact + overmasking issues
- 2026-04-01 — Jacket swap identified shoulder bleed from isotropic expansion

**History:**
- **2026-03-31 to 2026-04-01 | research + coding**
  Outcome: Debugged grey artifacts (mask_grow too small), overmasking (expansion too large), shoulder bleed (isotropic expansion into garment boundary). Created VACE_MASK_FAQ with 5 shot categories.
  Decision: bbox mode for object insertion (bag), as_is with tight settings for garment replacement (jacket). Different shot types need fundamentally different param strategies.
  Next: Test with updated param renames, use NV_VaceDebugPreview to verify mask coverage
- **2026-04-02/03 | coding + research**
  Outcome: Full body swap on dark BG — identified 6 artifact patterns. CropColorFix multiband Laplacian bleed is primary remaining issue. Four-region framework (R0⊆Rv⊆Rc⊆Rs) established.
  Decision: Use `crop_expand_px` for spatial coverage not `blend_expansion` (D-009). `boundary_lock` exposes not darkens (D-008). Multiband with `blend_pixels>8` on dark BGs = dark halo.
  Next: Try CropColorFix `composite_mode=hard`. V1 agent-assisted param suggestions.
- **2026-04-02/03 | coding + research (rolled from Pulse)**
  Outcome: Deprecated params removed (37 across 6 files). VACE_INPAINT_NODE_AUDIT.md (2,128 lines). VaceDebugPreview fixed. Multi-AI artifact research (10 files, ~120KB).
  Decision: Remove deprecated params, no backward compat (D-006). forceInput doesn't preserve values (D-007).
  Next: composite_mode=hard for dark BG halo. Agent-assisted param suggestions.

### D. Real-Time Mask Editor
**Current state:** STAGED — research complete, not started
**Goal:** Standalone tool for real-time visual mask parameter feedback (PySide6 + cached op graph)
**Key files:** `node_notes/research/2026-04-03_rt-mask-edit-tool-v1/` (10 research files, README with architecture decisions)
**Active constraints:** Must reuse `mask_ops.py` for production parity

**Milestones:**
- 2026-04-03 — Research complete: architecture decided (PySide6 + cached op graph MVP, two-speed long-term)

**History:**
- **2026-04-03 | research**
  Outcome: Multi-AI brainstorm (Codex+Gemini, 2 rounds) produced 3 architecture options. PySide6 + cached op graph selected for MVP. Two-speed (GPU approximation + Python validation) for long-term.
  Decision: PySide6 over web app (reuses mask_ops.py directly), cached op graph (slider invalidates only downstream), constraint-driven sliders as stretch goal.
  Next: Build MVP — load video+mask, real-time param sliders, export JSON to ComfyUI.

### E. Chunk Seam Continuity
**Current state:** ACTIVE — tail-as-control-video implemented, awaiting clean test
**Goal:** Eliminate fine-detail drift at chunk boundaries using VACE's native inpainting continuation (mask=0 preserved tail → mask=1 generation)
**Key files:** `vace_control_video_prep.py`, `vace_prepass_reference.py`, `seam_analyzer.py`, `node_notes/guides/PIPELINE_KNOWN_TRUTHS.md`
**Active constraints:** No identity_anchor until color-normalized. `control_masks`→VACE only. Tail overlap must be multiple of 4 (WAN 4k+1). Post-stitch tail prohibited.

**Milestones:**
- 2026-04-05 — 3 rounds multi-AI debate converged on Approach A (mask=0 tail prepend via VACE late-block skip connections)
- 2026-04-06 — Pixel tail tested (color drift), latent tail tested (domain mismatch). Both add artifacts.
- 2026-04-07 — Pivoted to tail-as-control-video (Approach B). VaceControlVideoPrep updated. Mask wiring clarified.

**History:**
- **2026-04-05/06 | coding + research**
  Outcome: Built NV_SeamAnalyzer + latent tail input on VacePrePassReference. Pixel tail caused color drift from VAE re-encode; latent path bypasses entirely. 3 multi-AI debate rounds + 3 code reviews.
  Decision: Latent tail preferred over pixel tail (D-012). Skip identity_anchor (D-010). VACE late-block mechanism confirmed (D-014).
  Next: Test latent tail on known-bad seam. Apply stitch crash fixes. Synthesize known-truths deep-dive.
- **2026-04-07 | coding + testing**
  Outcome: Latent tail tested — domain mismatch confirmed (D-015). Pivoted to tail-as-control-video in VaceControlVideoPrep (D-016). Critical review fixes applied. Mask wiring clarified (D-017).
  Decision: Sampler≠encoder latents (D-015). Tail-as-control-video preferred (D-016). control_masks→VACE only (D-017).
  Next: Clean end-to-end test of tail-as-control-video. Apply stitch fixes. Synthesize known-truths doc.

### F. Kling API Chunking
**Current state:** ACTIVE — chunk mode built + code-reviewed, awaiting runtime test
**Goal:** Enable Kling API processing for videos >10s via sequential chunking with tail-frame reference continuity
**Key files:** `kling_edit_fork.py`, `kling_stitch_adapter.py` (deprecated)
**Active constraints:** No overlap/crossfade (D-019). Max 4 ref images total (API limit). Kling output is standalone — not stitchable (D-018).

**Milestones:**
- 2026-04-07 — Sequential chunk mode implemented. KlingStitchAdapter deprecated. Multi-AI reviewed.

**History:**
- **2026-04-07 | coding**
  Outcome: Built chunk_mode on UploadPreview (auto-truncate + tail refs + next_chunk_start). Deprecated KlingStitchAdapter. Codex caught max_chunk_frames overshoot bug — fixed.
  Decision: No stitch-back (D-018), no crossfade (D-019). Hard cuts between chunks with ref-image consistency hints.
  Next: Runtime test on >10s video. Evaluate tail-frame ref effectiveness.
